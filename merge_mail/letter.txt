Hi [Name],
I hope you're doing well! I just wanted to follow up on our conversation from earlier this week. I’ve reviewed the points we discussed, and I think we’re in a great position to move forward.
If you're available, let’s set up a quick call sometime this week to finalize the next steps. Please let me know what day works best for you.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
Best regards
